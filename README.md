# decision-support-systems
📌 Overview:
This repository contains my university project on Decision Support Systems, implemented using GNU Octave. The project explores the simulation of Decision-Making Systems, based on a 
real-life scenario. The corresponding report explains the methodology, results, and conclusions.
